**The Project**

The purpose of this exercise was the build a website that would be simple, yet visually pleasing.

It's a single page site and includes a styled component which allowed me to use conditionals and ease-in-out more precisely. 

**The Cool Part**

Instead of having to create individual pages for each of the info sections, I created a file to store the data for each page:

Then all I had to do to create the different sections was use the template for the info section and plug in the corresponding data:

**The Components**

A hero video looping in the background was found for free online:

The images were free SVGs:

A sign in page was created as well, although it's currently not functional.
